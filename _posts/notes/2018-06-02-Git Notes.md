## Tip1 - What if we inadvertently use the Reset command and lose large changes?

Sometimes we do these operations：

```
git reset --hard HEAD^^^
```

Sometimes even:

```
git reset --hard HEAD^^^^^
```

What if we want to cancel the rollback?

Use 

```
git reflog
```

Then it shows the reset --hard Logs

```
389**09 HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD^^^
d02**f9 HEAD@{2}: reset: moving to HEAD^^
912**c7 HEAD@{3}: reset: moving to HEAD^
e4e**1d (origin/dev) HEAD@{4}: reset: moving to HEAD
e4e**1d (origin/dev) HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from master to dev
181**f4 (origin/master, master) HEAD@{6}: commit: remove prints
5e9**1d HEAD@{7}: commit (merge): update
634**96 HEAD@{8}: pull origin master: Fast-forward
cde**7c HEAD@{9}: reset: moving to HEAD
cde**7c HEAD@{10}: pull origin master: Fast-forward
389**09 HEAD@{11}: reset: moving to HEAD^^^
d02**f9 HEAD@{12}: reset: moving to HEAD^^
912**c7 HEAD@{13}: reset: moving to HEAD^
```

Then you can reset to some version by using:

```
get reset HASH
```

## Tip2 - What if we don't want some of the submitted records?

Sometimes you may do these things：

```
$ git add ./
$ git commit -m "add a new module of part 233" # add 982 lines
$ git add ./.../..
$ git commit -m "fix bug2, f**ck, sh**t !"  # add 162 lines, wrong changes, no need
$ git add ./.../..
$ git commit -m "fix some bugs"  # add 34 lines, This is the right changes
$ git add ./../
$ git commit -m "add a new module of part 243"  # add 378 lines
```

> Because of your upsetting bugs, accidentally leaving a few swear words on the git commit, but this interspersed in the commit record, what should you do?

- add a temp branch

```
git branch temp
```

- paste some logs of commits to the editor

```
git log # copy text to editor from LATEST commit start to commit end
```

- reset commits

```
git reset HASH # to the "add a new module of part 233" one
```

- chose some commits to recover

```
git cherry-pick HASH1
git cherry-pick HASH2
....
```

> Finally, the record you don't need will disappear in your current version.

## Tip4 - Set multi github account in One PC

#### 1.Open the git bash and input the codes:

```
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "shinepans@live.com (Your Email)"
```

And it outcomes:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/shinepans/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa_cess (id_rsa_cess:We need to create a new name that is different from the previous file name )
```

And it outcomes:

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): (Enter)
Enter same passphrase again:(Enter)
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa_cess.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa_cess.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jgkhEZIjeQNF6CZWU+sIpCUbZBIip+AdgQcZlnXlon0 shinepans@live.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|%/#=oo..         |
|^%+=o o          |
|*=+ooo .         |
|.+..=..          |
|+  o.o ES        |
|     ..+         |
|      o .        |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```


#### 2.Configure the ~/.ssh/config file


```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Host cess.github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cess
```

#### 2.Add the new generated SSH key to the associated Github account

> Add the newly generated key in id_rsa_cess.pub to the associated Github account. 

**And Then Use**

```
$ ssh -T git@cess.github.com
```

**to test whether the association is successful. The xxx.github.com used here is the name of the second host in the previous config.**

And it should be outcomes:

```
$ Hi cessuser! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

#### 3.Use multiple SSH Key

If we need use default account whose ssh key is id_ras.pub, we can use 

```
git clone git@github.com:USER/SOMETHING.git
```

If we need use another account whose ssh key is id_ras_cess.pub, we can use 

```
git clone git@cess.github.com:USER/SOMETHING.git
