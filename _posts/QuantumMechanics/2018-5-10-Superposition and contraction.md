## Superposition and contraction

Let us give an example to explain the concept of quantum mechanics. Let's talk about ordinary people's daily experience. Most people think that an objective object must be in a certain position and that it is deterministic. This existence is not based on the will of man and is objective. For example, my daughter is now in the living room, or my daughter is not in the living room. Both must be one.

### Can my daughter be in and out of the living room?

Quantum mechanics can say that the daughter is in the living room and not in the living room. When it is necessary to confirm whether the daughter is in the living room, we need to observe the action. When the observation occurs, the daughter's state of existence is collapsed. From the original state of being in the living room and not in the living room, it becomes the only state in the living room or not in the living room.

### Electronic at the same time in two places

When electrons are not observed, there is no definite state. **Quantum mechanics is inseparable from consciousness, and consciousness is the foundation of quantum mechanics.**

**Live and living superimposed cats**

Put a cat in a closed box, and then attach the box to a device that contains a nucleus and a poison gas facility. There is a 50 percent chance that the atomic nucleus decays. When it decays, it emits a particle. Once this particle is emitted, it triggers a poison gas facility. When the poison gas triggers, it kills the cat. In this kind of dead and alive superposition

### Can We Avoid Conscious Participation from Uncertainty to Determination?

> Victor Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1963, thought of a new way. He said: "I let a friend wear a gas mask and stay in that box with the cat. I hide behind the door and come to me." Saying that this cat is dead or alive I do not know that cats are both dead and alive. Afterwards, I asked the friend who was wearing a gas mask in the gas chamber. Is the cat dead or alive? A friend will certainly answer that cats are either dead or alive, and they are not half dead.

When he came up with this statement, everyone discovered that there was a problem. Where was the problem? When a person and a cat are together in a box, the person is conscious. Once the consciousness is included in the system of quantum mechanics, its wave function is collapsed and the cat becomes either dead or alive. In other words, a cat is dead or alive. As long as one's consciousness is involved, it becomes either dead or alive. It is no longer a state of ambiguity.

Wigner concluded that when friend's consciousness is contained in the entire system, superposition does not apply. Even if he himself is outside the door, the wave function in the box is constantly being touched by the observations of his friends, so only live cats or dead cats are possible.

Wigner believes that consciousness can act on the outside world and it is not surprising that the wave function is deflated. Really can only think so. Because changes in the external world can cause changes in our consciousness.

Consciousness is the ability to change the objective world. Consciousness changes the objective world by contracting the wave function, that is, changing the state of uncertainty into a certain state.

### The core of measurement is human consciousness

Natural science is always self-declared as the most objective and most tolerant of subjective consciousness. Now that quantum mechanics has developed to this point, human subjective consciousness is found to be the basis of the objective material world.

The basis of quantum mechanics is: From the uncertain state to the determined state, we must participate consciously. This is a major achievement in physics.

At this point, we have already understood some of the bizarre differences in quantum mechanics. The bizarre basis is actually that consciousness and the material world cannot be separated. Consciousness contributes to the transfer of the material world from uncertainty to certainty.

This is very much like the concept of Buddhism, when one thought suddenly created the material world. The fact that the material world emerged actually changed from uncertainties to certainty. Both are similar.

### Multibody Superposition: Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is similar to "Schrodinger's Cat," except that "Schrodinger's Cat" is a superposition of the same thing in a different state. Quantum entanglement is about the fact that if there are more than two things, they are in different states. The superposition, they must have a clear relationship between each other. This is quantum entanglement.
